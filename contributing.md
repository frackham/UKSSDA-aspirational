** Contribute
At this stage, the UKSSDA project is an MSc dissertation project for Kingston University. However, if you are interested in the development of the project, please get in touch with me on Twitter @frackham_edu .

Before you get involved
* Please read the Ethos, Principles and Non-negotiables of the project. There are certain aspects which are not going to change at this stage (such as switching to Java!). These may be up for discussion at a later date, but in the interest of maintaining focus they are not at this time. Of course, you can fork the project whether you agree with these or not.
* Have a look at the Architecture page, as this will give you a top-level view of the application structure.
* It will help if you understand the limitations of a Google App Engine hosted application, and in particular the Google Data Store. A longer term goal _is _to move away from the Google PAAS, but not until a fully viable alternative has been scoped out.
 
Ways in which you can contribute
* Fork the project, and add some code! As noted above, at this stage I am unlikely to approve pull requests as this is a marked piece of work.
* Improve the documentation.
* Add bugs and feature requests using the issue tracker.
* Discuss how you would use the app at your school, and feedback to me through either this wiki (create a new page) or through Twitter as above. Examples of real use cases are always valuable!
